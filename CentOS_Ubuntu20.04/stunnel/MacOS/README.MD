# installing of stunnel for MacOS

- - - Usage:

1. Press Command+Space and type Terminal and press enter/return key.

2. Run in Terminal app:

```ruby
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
cd /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Tabs/homebrew
git clone https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core.git
brew install stunnel
```
- and press enter/return key.

3. Run:
```brew    
brew install stunnel
```
And then it says, "Done! You can now use stunnel."

Well, not exactly. Where do I put my stunnel.conf and certificate.pem? How do I
make stunnel run automatically at boot time?

The web instructions aren't very complete. Need additional assistance.
