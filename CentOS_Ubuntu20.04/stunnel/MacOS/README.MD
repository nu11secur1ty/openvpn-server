# installing of stunnel for MacOS

- - - Usage:

1. Press Command+Space and type Terminal and press enter/return key.

2. Run in Terminal app:

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" < /dev/null 2> /dev/null
    and press enter/return key.

3. Run:
    brew install stunnel

And then it says, "Done! You can now use stunnel."

Well, not exactly. Where do I put my stunnel.conf and certificate.pem? How do I
make stunnel run automatically at boot time?

The web instructions aren't very complete. Need additional assistance.
