This script will let you set up your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

### Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget https://git.io/vpn -O openvpn-install.sh && bash openvpn-install.sh`

  or

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nu11secur1ty/openvpn-server/master/Debian/openvpn-install.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.
